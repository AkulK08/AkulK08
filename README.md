Hi! I'm Akul and I'm currently a HS Junior who's interested in math modelling and ML. 
This repository contains some linear/polynomial regression models I've created using ML, as well as a bunch of other stuff. 
I created most of this depository while I was interning in ML/math modelling at Iora Eco. Solutions. 
The library is organized into the subcategories of linear regressions, polynomial regressions, and other. 
The programs inside are separated by category. 
Have fun!
